# Switch Window and Scroll Automation Script

## Description
This project demonstrates the use of **Selenium WebDriver** to automate switching between browser windows and performing scrolling actions using **JavaScript Executor**. The script opens a new browser window, switches to it, performs scrolling operations, and then returns to the main window, ensuring clean and efficient automation of window handling.

## Features
- Automates window switching between the main and new browser windows.
- Maximizes the newly opened window for better visibility.
- Implements smooth scroll-down and scroll-up actions using **JavaScript Executor**.
- Waits between operations to simulate real user interactions.
- Ensures all browser windows are properly handled and closed after execution.
